The patch in chromium.patch was applied on top of this; I will talk with
upstream about it.  (Note that chromium.patch is just a record of our
changes against upstream; you must also apply any changes that you make to
the checked-in copy of the source.)

Added support for building on Android.

The patch for Arabic alignment bug was added (bug 105685).

Added patch for compiling with clang ARM for Android.

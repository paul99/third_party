Chromium.

The libvpx source is from webmproject.org:
  git://review.webmproject.org/libvpx

Notes on updating libvpx source code.

Please follow these steps to update libvpx source code:

1. Update libvpx source tree. Look for current commit hash:<hash> output to
   update README.chromium.

   ./update_libvpx.sh [branch name]

2. Generate updated .gypi and config files.

   ./generate_gypi.sh

3. Update this README with any Version, Date, Branch, and Commit changes. The
   version is in the file source/config/vpx_version.h

4. Commit the changes in root (I.e README & .gypi files), source/libvpx, and
   source/config directories.

Tools needed to build libvpx:

- generate_gypi.sh

Generate config and .gypi files that contain the source list for each platform.
Configuration for the build is taken from vpx_config.h for each platform.

- lint_config.sh

A tool to verify vpx_config.h and vpx_config.asm are matched. This also
prints the final configuration after checking.

- unpack_lib_posix.sh

Unpack a static library of .a type. This tool takes a list of possible
locations of the library file and extract the content.

- copy_obj.sh

A copy utility from a list of candidate locations.

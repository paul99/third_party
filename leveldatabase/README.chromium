Description:
Alternative to SQLite used as the backend for IndexedDB and internally by the
FileSystem API implementation and others.

Local Additions:
* gyp file for building in chromium
* port/port_chromium.{h,cc} and env_chromium.cc provide chromium implementations
  of primitives used by leveldb.  E.g. threading, file handling, etc.
* chromium_logger.h was copied from src/util/posix_logger.h and updated to use
  chrome primitives in place of some posix primitives

Current patches:

to_upstream/
10_realloc_mismatch.patch
  phajdan.jr: Fixes a mismatch between posix_memalign and realloc
  detected by debugallocation (http://crbug.com/30715). Pointer passed
  to realloc must come from malloc, calloc or realloc, which was not the case.

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.

07_remove_av_gettime_symlink.patch
  dalecurtis: In order to preserve ABI compatibility after av_gettime() was
  moved inside the FFmpeg code base, they added a "symbolic link" version which
  our build chain doesn't like.  Remove it until the next major version bump.

08_add_vp9_support.patch
  tomfinegan: Add support for VP9 in WebM:
